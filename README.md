# NanDraft

### A full stack TypeScript/Node.js project where I create a websocket application of a league of legends resource called DRAFT. Where a player can select your champion and ban the enemy champion too.

[Whats is draft?](https://riftfeed.gg/guides/lol-draft-everything-you-need-to-know)

**I opted to create a vanilla client (without libraries like React, Vue and Angular) cause it's more performatic, and I want to prove to myself that I can make something great with any technology.**
